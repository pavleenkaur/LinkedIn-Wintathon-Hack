About : A 12 hour in-office Hackathon, with students divided in teams of 3 and 4
Hack Idea : The hack addressed two core recruitment problems : 
<ol>
<li>Out of thousands of applications, comparing and picking the best is a messy job for the recruiters. How can this be simplified?</li>
<li>A candidate has applied for a job and is still waiting or is getting many rejections and is not able to figure out why. What can they do? </li>
</ol>

Our Solution :<br>
<b>From the Recruiter Side</b>
<ul>
<li>Filtering out the ineligible candidates</li>
<li>Ranking the applicants based on the profiles of the employees of the current working team </li>
<li>Ranking the applicants amongst themselves based on their profiles and the job description</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>From the Applicant Side</b>
<ul>
<li>Notifying the applicant with the status of their job application</li>
<li>Providing the summary of their skills compared to the shortlisted candidates</li>
<li>Highlighting the areas where they are lacking in and recommend necessary courses, useful groups etc</li>
</ul>
